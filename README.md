# Trends in Birth Rates
## A 20 Year Analysis
## 

> Capstone project for Data Analytics Cohort #11 at Nashville Software School


## Overview

Welcome to the presentation of Analyzing Trends in Birth Rates. This project examines patterns and trends in birth rates over the years, providing insights into how they have been influenced by various factors. The analysis covers seven different trends using a combination of Excel, PowerBI, and Python. The seven different trends analyzed are:

- Average births per month 
- Average births per day
- Total births by year
- Extended look at births per year
- Total births on specific dates
- Top 10 highest and lowest births
- Births on special dates

## Motivation

Birth rates are a fundamental demographic indicator that reflect the health, economic conditions, and cultural aspects of a society. Understanding the trends in birth rates over the years can provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers. This project aims to uncover patterns and anomalies in birth rates, exploring the factors that contribute to these changes. By analyzing birth rate data, we can better understand population growth, plan for future resource allocation, and develop strategies to address societal challenges.

This analysis not only highlights historical trends but also opens up discussions on how current events and policies may impact future birth rates. Whether it's for academic purposes, policy-making, or general interest, this project serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in demographic trends and their implications.
